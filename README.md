# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption
         
This is a simple Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher**, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters by a specified number of places in the alphabet.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher.
- Decrypt an encrypted message back to its original form.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Retains spaces and special characters without modification.
 
## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The user chooses whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a message.
2. The user inputs a message and a **shift value** (key).
3. The program shifts each letter in the message based on the key:
   - Encryption: Shifts letters forward.
   - Decryption: Shifts letters backward.
4. The result is displayed to the user.
